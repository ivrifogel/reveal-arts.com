    journal: "JoCAT, Volume 20, Number 1, 2025",
    abstract: "This article is an integration of two creative arts therapy (CAT) studies that were conducted simultaneously in two special education middle schools, one from the perspective of the therapists and the other from the perspective of the parents of the student-clients. It explores the therapist's perception of their role within the school framework and of their relationship with the parents of the student-clients. It also examines parental expectations of the skills and training of the creative arts therapist and the school framework.",

    abstract: "While dance movement therapy (DMT) and art therapy (AT) have been found to improve Parkinson's disease (PD) patients' motor and non-motor symptoms, there is currently no research that addresses the effects of these therapies on PD caregivers. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the effect of art and dance therapy on PD caregivers. Twenty-seven PD patients and ten caregivers underwent either group AT, group DMT or co-group therapy (both group AT and group DMT combined in one session). In addition, all attended 10\u201312 sessions of group therapy. Nine patients also attended individual AT and DMT for at least 10 sessions. Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ8) and Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale-2 (PDSS-2) pre- and post-therapy sessions. HADS and Zarit Burden Interview scores were recorded for their caregivers. Patients' anxiety, PDSS and PDQ8 were not significantly different post-intervention, but depression scores significantly improved in caregivers post-intervention. Additionally, depression in patients who attended the sessions with their caregivers improved significantly compared to those who attended alone. Thus, this study shows that art and dance therapy can improve depression scores amongst PD caregivers and PD patients who attend sessions with their caregivers.",

    title: "Therapists' Perception of their Relationship with Educational Staff in Secondary Inclusive Schools",
    authors: "Meytal Fogel-Simhony",
    year: 2021,
    journal: "Advances in Social Sciences Research Journal, Vol. 8, No. 3",
    doi: "10.14738/assrj.83.9812",
    abstract: "Due to the disparities inherent in the role perception of expressive and creative therapists in the Israeli educational system, and the difficulty of fulfilling the role in an optimal manner for all parties involved, this study aims to examine the role perception of the therapist in secondary schools with inclusive education, examining the therapist's work vis-a-vis the school's educational staff and its management team. The sample included 11 therapists who have worked in a secondary school for over two years. The data was collected through semi-structured interviews. Findings of the study indicated a number of significant parameters in the therapist's work vis-\u00e0-vis the staff. Moreover, it is evident that the therapist's own role perception is related to the role perception as perceived by the educational and management team. The discussion examines the significance of the disparity between the therapist's role perception and the expectations and perceptions of the staff within the educational system.",

    abstract: "Art therapy is a method of treatment that involves the mental world of human beings. The purpose of this therapy is to improve the patient's emotional and physical functioning and condition. Art therapy is utilized for emotional and mental problems and as a diagnostic tool. This therapeutic technique is currently common in a wide variety of settings in varied therapeutic and rehabilitative settings such as: educational settings, hospitals and mental health centres. With regard to interventions implemented within schools, the significance and comprehension of art therapy is lacking. The purpose of this study is to identify the variety of interventions that exist in the literature on integration of art therapy in schools. Furthermore, this article will present the methods of evaluation, the results, as well as factors that influence the existence of this intervention. The results of the systematic review might be useful for continuing and expanding the integration of art therapy within schools.",
